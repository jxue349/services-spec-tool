# AI Spec Explorer

A Git-versioned **Product Behavior Specification** is the single source of
truth. A *behavior compiler* — Glean's Chat API, called server-side — turns
that one document into four representations:

| Tab | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Ask** | The main surface. A question in, an answer out, with the rules it rests on and their status. Retrieves over the spec rather than sending all of it |
| **Behavior Explorer** | Resolves entitlements for a built scenario, and answers free-form "what if…?" questions |
| **QA Test Matrix** | 15–25 test cases, weighted toward behavior the prototype never visualized |
| **State Machine** | The subscription lifecycle as a Mermaid diagram plus a transitions table |
| **Consistency Check** | Every rule in the spec scored against prototype coverage and QA coverage |
| **Parent Check** | A child spec against the parent knowledge base: what merges, what contradicts, what is already covered — then opens a change request |

Every conclusion cites the rule IDs (`R-xxx`) it came from, and every rule ID
renders as a chip that reveals that rule in the spec editor.

The demo loop is: **edit a rule → recompile → the outputs move → check the
change back in as a pull request.** Compilers always run against the text in
the editor, including uncommitted edits.

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # then fill in the values
npm install
npm run dev             # http://localhost:3000
```

### Environment variables

All server-side. There are deliberately **no `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables** — no
key, token, owner, or repo name reaches the client bundle.

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GLEAN_CLIENT_ID` + `GLEAN_CLIENT_SECRET` | yes† | — | OAuth client for the `client_credentials` grant. Preferred — see below |
| `GLEAN_SCOPE` | no | `chat` | Scope requested for the client-credentials token |
| `GLEAN_API_KEY` | yes† | — | Alternative: long-lived platform token from [app.glean.com/admin/platform/token](https://app.glean.com/admin/platform/token) |
| `GLEAN_INSTANCE` | yes\* | — | Instance name; the backend origin is `https://<instance>-be.glean.com` |
| `GLEAN_BASE_URL` | no | — | Full backend origin, for deployments that don't follow that pattern. Overrides `GLEAN_INSTANCE` |
| `GLEAN_AGENT` | no | `GPT` | Which Glean agent answers. **Leave this as `GPT`** — see below |
| `GLEAN_MODE` | no | `DEFAULT` | Reasoning mode passed through to Glean |
| `GLEAN_ACT_AS` | no | — | Required only when the token is a *global* rather than user-scoped Glean token |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | yes | — | Fine-grained PAT for the spec repo (scoping below) |
| `GITHUB_OWNER` | yes | — | Owner of the spec repo |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | yes | — | Spec repo name |
| `SPEC_PATH` | no | `spec/behavior.md` | Path of the spec file in that repo |
| `SPEC_BASE_BRANCH` | no | `main` | Branch treated as the state of record |
| `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` | no | `AI Spec Explorer` | Commit author for spec commits |
| `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` | no | `spec-explorer@wyze.com` | Commit author email |
| `ALLOW_DIRECT_COMMIT` | no | `false` | Allows committing straight to the base branch |

\* Either `GLEAN_INSTANCE` or `GLEAN_BASE_URL` must be set.
† Set **exactly one** of the OAuth client or `GLEAN_API_KEY`. Configuring both
is rejected at startup rather than silently preferring one, so a stale key
can't sit around looking load-bearing.

### Getting a Glean credential

You do **not** need an admin-issued platform token. Glean's authorization
server advertises the `client_credentials` grant:

```bash
curl -s https://<instance>-be.glean.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server/oauth
# grant_types_supported: ['authorization_code', 'client_credentials', 'refresh_token']
# token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported: ['none','client_secret_basic','client_secret_post','private_key_jwt']
```

So ask for an OAuth client (client id + secret) with the `chat` scope, set
`GLEAN_CLIENT_ID` / `GLEAN_CLIENT_SECRET`, and the app handles the rest: it
exchanges them at `/oauth/token` using `client_secret_basic`, caches the token
until a minute before expiry, and re-mints once if a cached token is rejected.

**Glean's MCP endpoint is not an alternative credential.** `/mcp/default` and
`/rest/api/v1/chat` sit behind the same authorization server and the same
`Authorization: Bearer` wall — both return the same `WWW-Authenticate`
challenge pointing at `/oauth`. MCP is a protocol for letting an *agent*
discover tools; this app makes exactly one known call, so MCP would add an
OAuth-session layer for no benefit over a single `fetch`.

### Why `agent=GPT`

The compiler runs on Glean's Chat API. Glean's `agentConfig.agent` decides
whether Glean *searches your company's content* before answering:

| `agent` | Retrieval | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GPT` | **none** — straight to the LLM | What this tool needs. Glean is deprecating it |
| `DEFAULT` | company knowledge | Deprecating |
| `FAST` | agentic engine, retrieval-capable | Must be enabled in the deployment |
| `ADVANCED` | same, slower and higher quality | Must be enabled in the deployment |

This tool's entire premise is that **the spec text in the editor is the only
source of truth**, and that the compiler names a spec gap rather than filling
one in. A retrieval agent breaks that: asked about Cam Plus grace periods it
will find the real Confluence page, the real Jira ticket, and the real Slack
thread, and blend them into an answer that *looks* spec-derived. The
consistency check would then report coverage for behavior the spec never
defines — which is worse than no answer, because it reads as authoritative.

So `GPT` is the default, an unrecognised `GLEAN_AGENT` is a hard startup error
rather than a silent fallback, and a test asserts the outgoing request carries
`agent: "GPT"`.

**This needs revisiting.** Glean lists both `DEFAULT` and `GPT` as deprecating
in favour of `FAST`/`ADVANCED`. When `GPT` goes away, the replacement is not a
drop-in: you will need a Glean agent whose `gleanSearchConfig` is *omitted*
(their agent spec defines an omitted `gleanSearchConfig` as "no company
knowledge access") and to invoke it by `agentId`. Do not just switch to
`FAST` and hope.

### One more consequence of using Glean

The spec text is sent to Glean on every compile, so it lands in Glean's chat
infrastructure. Requests set `saveChat: false` so they are not kept as named
chats, but this is Glean's retention policy, not ours. If the spec is ever
more sensitive than "internal", check that against your Glean data-retention
and governance settings before pointing this at it.

### GitHub token scoping

Create a **fine-grained personal access token** limited to the single spec
repo. Do not use a classic PAT, and do not grant org-wide scopes.

1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → **Personal access tokens →
   Fine-grained tokens** → *Generate new token*.
2. **Resource owner**: the org or user that owns the spec repo.
3. **Repository access**: *Only select repositories* → pick the spec repo, and
   nothing else.
4. **Repository permissions** — exactly three, nothing more:
   - **Contents**: Read and write (read the spec, create the branch and commit)
   - **Pull requests**: Read and write (open the PR)
   - **Issues**: Read and write (log questions the spec cannot answer)

   Without Issues the spec flows all work and only gap logging fails, with a
   message saying which permission is missing.
5. Leave every account permission at *No access*. `workflow`, `admin`, and
   `delete_repo` are never needed; if something asks for them, stop.
6. Set an expiry and put a calendar reminder to rotate it.

The token lives only in the server environment. If you deploy this, set it as a
runtime secret — never in the image, the repo, or a build arg.

### If the spec file does not exist yet

The app shows an **Initialize spec in repo** button. It commits a starter Wyze
subscription-management spec (channels, entitlement scopes, rules R-101 to
R-401, lifecycle states, and a prototype-coverage list) through the same
pull-request flow as any other change — the first version gets reviewed like
every version after it.

## Ask

Ask is the surface support agents and users of this tool come to. It takes a
question, not a spec to compile, so the answer leads and the evidence follows.

**It retrieves rather than sending the whole document.** The parent knowledge
base is 74 KB across 172 rules and grows with every distillation; a question
about Pro AI pricing sends the ~50 rules that bear on it, not all 172. In
practice that is a 75 KB prompt down to ~26 KB, and the model is not asked to
find a needle in a document it half-reads. Retrieval is lexical
(`lib/spec-retrieval.ts`) because rule text is dense with exact identifiers —
`feature-cloud-60`, `GW_WBDC`, `ADDON-011` — that questions quote verbatim, and
an exact match on those beats semantic similarity with no index to keep fresh.
Naming a rule id in the question retrieves that rule outright.

**Answers carry rule status.** The knowledge base marks every rule ✅ Confirmed,
⚠️ Unverified, 🔴 Open or ⛔ Superseded, and its own `GOV-006` says answers may
be asserted only from confirmed rules. So each citation shows its status, an
answer resting on anything weaker comes back with a caveat telling the agent
not to assert it to a customer, and a superseded rule is never answered from as
though it were current.

**It says when the spec does not answer.** Confidence `none` plus a named spec
gap, rather than a plausible guess. If retrieval matches nothing at all, the
route answers that directly without calling the model.

Scope: with a child spec selected, a toggle switches between asking that spec
and asking the knowledge base.

### The gap log

A question the spec cannot answer is the most useful signal this tool
produces: a real person needed an answer the organisation has not written
down. **Flag to knowledge-base owners** turns it into a GitHub issue labelled
`kb-gap`, carrying the question, which spec was asked, what retrieval found,
and an @-mention of the parent spec's followers. Owners get a reviewable
backlog and decide what to distil into the knowledge base.

Issues rather than pull requests: a gap is a question to be answered, not a
change to merge, and it needs somewhere to be discussed before anyone knows
what the rule should say.

Asking the same question twice joins the existing issue instead of filing a
duplicate. That check is in two places on purpose — GitHub's issue list is
eventually consistent, so an issue filed seconds ago is not reliably returned
by the next list call, and the API check alone files duplicates. A short
in-process memo covers that window. Both paths share one definition of "same
question" (`gapKey`), so they cannot disagree about whether two flags match.

### Why not Glean's MCP for this

Glean's MCP server indexes company content — Confluence, Jira, Slack. The
parent spec lives in Git and is served by this app, so it is not in that index;
MCP cannot retrieve it. MCP is also the same service behind the same OAuth wall
as the Chat API already in use, so it adds a protocol layer rather than a
capability. Retrieval therefore runs over the spec document itself, which is
also what keeps the answer provably spec-derived.

## The parent knowledge base

One parent spec is the organisation-wide knowledge base for subscription
management, entitlement, and upsell behavior. Each new spec lives in its own
directory and is distilled and merged into the parent over time.

```
spec/
  parent.md              SPEC_PARENT_PATH — the knowledge base
  followers.txt          who reviews changes to it
  cam-plus/behavior.md   a child spec
  upsell/behavior.md
```

Pick which spec the compilers run against with the selector in the left panel.
It is deliberately one-at-a-time: each spec is its own source of truth until it
merges into the parent, and compiling a union of documents would make rule
citations ambiguous about which spec they came from.

**Rule IDs are namespaced per spec** — `CAMPLUS-R-101` — so merging children
into the parent cannot collide and a citation always says where it came from.
Bare `R-xxx` stays valid for the parent.

### Requesting a change to the parent

**Parent Check** compares the selected child against the parent and classifies
every rule as an `addition` (parent is silent), a `contradiction` (both define
it, incompatibly), or a `duplicate`. Then **Request change to parent** opens a
pull request against the parent spec.

Two rules govern what that PR contains:

- **Only additions are applied**, and they are applied by deterministic string
  work in `lib/merge-additions.ts`, not by asking the model to rewrite the
  parent. A model rewrite of the knowledge base could silently reword or drop
  rules nobody asked it to touch, and the parent is the one document that must
  never change by accident. Re-requesting is idempotent: a rule the parent
  already has is skipped, not duplicated.
- **Contradictions are never applied.** Which spec wins is a product decision,
  so they travel to the followers as a table in the PR body instead.

The request always goes out as a pull request, whatever `ALLOW_DIRECT_COMMIT`
says. The knowledge base always gets reviewed.

### Followers

`spec/followers.txt` (beside the parent spec) lists one GitHub username per
line; `#` starts a comment.

They are requested as PR reviewers. **GitHub only allows review requests for
users with repo access**, which the people who care most about subscription
behavior often do not have — so anyone GitHub refuses is `@`-mentioned in the
PR body instead, which still notifies them. The app reports which happened:

```
1 rule(s) merged · mentioned jxue349, octocat (no write access)
```

This is why followers live in a plain file rather than CODEOWNERS: CODEOWNERS
can only name people who can push.

## How spec changes get checked in

Default and recommended path:

1. Edit the spec in the left panel. The editor tracks dirty state.
2. **Check in changes** → enter a summary (the commit message and PR title are
   pre-filled as `spec: <summary>`).
3. The server re-reads the file's blob SHA. If it moved since you loaded it,
   you get a **409** and a *spec changed upstream* prompt with the upstream
   content — nothing is overwritten silently.
4. Otherwise it creates `spec/update-<timestamp>` from the base branch head,
   commits, opens a pull request, and hands back the PR link.

**Why a PR and not a commit:** a spec change is a product-truth change, so it
needs review, and a merged PR gives a one-click revert path.

Direct commits to the base branch require **both** `ALLOW_DIRECT_COMMIT=true`
*and* an explicit two-step confirmation in the check-in dialog. The upstream
SHA check still applies. Use it only against a throwaway sandbox repo.

### Rollback

The spec's history is the repo's history, so rollback is a Git operation:

- **A merged spec PR made things worse** → open the merged PR on GitHub and hit
  **Revert**. That opens a revert PR; merge it and the spec is back to the
  previous behavior. This is the normal path.
- **A direct commit** (only possible with `ALLOW_DIRECT_COMMIT=true`) →
  `git revert <sha>` and push, or open a PR with the revert.
- **A bad PR that has not merged** → just close it. The base branch never moved.
- After any rollback, press **Pull latest** in the app and recompile; the four
  views follow whatever is now on the base branch.

The **History** drawer lists the last 10 commits touching the spec path, each
linking to GitHub, so you can find the commit to revert.

## Architecture

Single deployable Next.js (App Router) service: React frontend plus API routes
as the backend. No database — GitHub holds the spec, and UI state is React
state.

```
app/
  page.tsx                      two-panel UI, owns spec + draft state
  api/spec/route.ts             GET    read spec at base branch head
  api/spec/refresh/route.ts     POST   "Pull latest"
  api/spec/history/route.ts     GET    last 10 commits for the spec path
  api/spec/commit/route.ts      POST   SHA check -> branch -> commit -> PR
  api/spec/init/route.ts        POST   seed the starter spec via the PR flow
  api/compile/{explorer,tests,states,consistency}/route.ts
components/                     spec panel, dialogs, the four tabs
lib/
  env.ts          server-only env access
  github.ts       Octokit client + the commit orchestration (injectable)
  glean.ts        compile(): Glean Chat call, answer extraction, retries
  json.ts         fence strip -> brace-balanced extract -> parse -> zod
  prompts.ts      the four compiler prompts
  schemas.ts      request + response contracts (zod)
  ratelimit.ts    in-memory per-IP limiter
  client/         typed fetch wrappers, rule lookup, exports, mermaid source
tests/            unit + mocked-integration tests
```

### Security posture

- **Secrets are server-side only.** `GLEAN_API_KEY` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` are
  read in `lib/env.ts`, which is imported exclusively by API routes. Verified
  against the built bundle — no token, key, or env name appears in
  `.next/static`.
- **Errors never leak.** Clients get a friendly message plus an 8-character
  request ID; details are logged server-side through a redactor that masks
  `github_pat_…`, a `Bearer …` value, or an auth header. Glean error bodies are
  never forwarded to the client, only the status.
- **All input is validated and bounded** with zod: spec ≤ 100 KB, what-if
  question ≤ 500 chars, ≤ 10 scenario devices, bounded strings everywhere.
  Anything else is a 400.
- **Model output is untrusted**, and doubly so here: Glean Chat has no
  structured-output or JSON-schema mode, so nothing at the API level guarantees
  the reply is JSON. Replies are fence-stripped, brace-balance-extracted,
  parsed, and schema-validated, with one corrective retry; everything renders as text
  through React's default escaping. The one place HTML is injected is the
  Mermaid diagram, and that is Mermaid's own output under
  `securityLevel: 'strict'`, built from state and event labels already
  whitelisted to plain label characters in `lib/client/mermaid-source.ts`.
- **Rate limit** of 20 compiles/min/IP on the compile routes, so a stuck client
  cannot burn API spend. It is in-memory and per-process — a cost guard, not an
  auth boundary. Put a real limiter at the edge before exposing this publicly.
- **Timeouts and retries**: 30s timeout with one transport retry on Glean calls
  (408/429/5xx and timeouts only — a rejected token is not retried), plus one
  corrective retry when the reply fails schema validation.
- **No auth on the app itself.** It is an internal pilot tool. Anyone who can
  reach it can open a PR against the spec repo as the token identity — put it
  behind SSO before it leaves a trusted network.

## Tests

```bash
npm test          # vitest
npm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit, strict
npm run lint      # eslint (flat config, next/core-web-vitals + next/typescript)
```

### Trying the app without credentials

`npm run stub:glean` starts a local stand-in for Glean's chat endpoint on
127.0.0.1:3399. Point the app at it:

```
GLEAN_API_KEY=local-stub-token
GLEAN_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3399
```

All four tabs then compile for real — through the routes and `lib/glean.ts` —
with no token and no quota burn, which also makes the demo rehearsable offline.
The stub replies the way a chat assistant actually does (prose wrapped around a
` ```json ` fence), so the extraction pipeline is genuinely exercised.

`curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3399/__log` shows what the app sent: the agent
config, whether a bearer header was present, and whether the prompt carried the
spec. Use it to confirm `agent: "GPT"` is really going over the wire.

The GitHub side still needs a real token — the stub only covers Glean.

- `tests/json.test.ts` — fence stripping, brace-balanced extraction (including
  braces and escaped quotes inside strings), schema validation errors.
- `tests/commit-conflict.test.ts` — the SHA-conflict logic and commit
  orchestration, driven through a fake repo client: conflict detection,
  first-time create, upstream deletion, "no write happens on conflict", and
  both direct-commit guards.
- `tests/compile-routes.test.ts` — one integration test per compile route with
  Glean mocked at the `fetch` boundary: response shapes, request construction
  (endpoint, bearer header, `saveChat: false`, **`agent: "GPT"`**, `ActAs` only
  when configured), prompt construction (full spec present, citation contract
  present), answer extraction from Glean's message/fragment structure,
  input-validation 400s, the corrective retry, the 502 after two bad replies,
  transport retry on 429/5xx, 401 → 502 with no token echoed, timeout → 504,
  and the rate limit.
- `tests/rules-and-mermaid.test.ts` — rule lookup in spec text, Mermaid label
  sanitising, Markdown/CSV export escaping.

## Deploy

Single Node service.

```bash
docker build -t ai-spec-explorer .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env ai-spec-explorer
```

The image runs as a non-root user, uses Next's `standalone` output (no build
tooling at runtime), and contains no secrets — pass them in at run time as
environment variables or mounted secrets.
